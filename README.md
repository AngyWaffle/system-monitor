# system-monitor
Python based system-monitor with real time monitoring and alerts for windows and linux.

To install the app, run installer.py in sudo

The program adds the alarms.py file as a service that runs in the background and starts on boot.
The program gives you the option to add a shortcut to monitor.py.

When you run the installer it installs all the libraries in requirements.txt including tkinter.

As of now the app is untested in windows.
